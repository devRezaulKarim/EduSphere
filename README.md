# 📃 Authentication & Role Management

---

### 1. 📌 Feature Overview

Authentication & Role Management is the entry point of the LMS. It ensures secure user login and access control based on roles (**Admin, Instructor, Student**). Each role has different permissions and dashboards.

---

### 2. 🎯 Goals & Non-Goals

✅ **Goals:**

* Secure login/signup system.
* Support role-based access control (RBAC).
* Social logins (Google, GitHub).
* Session management (JWT / cookies).

❌ **Non-Goals (future):**

* Passwordless login (email magic link).
* Multi-tenancy (multiple organizations).

---

### 3. 👤 User Stories

* As a **student**, I want to create an account and log in so that I can enroll in courses.
* As an **instructor**, I want to log in and manage my courses so that I can teach students.
* As an **admin**, I want to manage users and permissions so that the platform remains secure.

---

### 4. ✅ Acceptance Criteria

* User can sign up with email/password.
* User can log in via email/password or Google/GitHub OAuth.
* Role is stored in the database and returned in the session.
* Unauthorized role → access denied (redirect to login).
* Session persists after refresh.

---

### 5. 🏗️ Component Architecture

**Main Components:**

* `<AuthForm />` – login & signup form.
* `<SocialLogin />` – Google/GitHub login buttons.
* `<ProfileMenu />` – avatar dropdown (profile, logout).
* `<RoleGate />` – wrapper for role-based protection.

**State Management:**

* Authentication handled by **NextAuth**.
* Role stored in **JWT session token**.
* Middleware enforces RBAC on protected routes.

**Data Flow:**

```
User → <AuthForm> / <SocialLogin> → NextAuth → [Database] → JWT Session → RoleGate → Protected Page
```

---

### 6. 📑 API Contracts

* `POST /api/auth/signup` → `{ success: true, user: { id, email, role } }`
* `POST /api/auth/login` → `{ success: true, token, role }`
* `GET /api/auth/session` → `{ user: { id, name, email, role } }`
* `POST /api/auth/logout` → `{ success: true }`

---

### 7. 🎨 UX & Design Notes

* Minimal login/signup form (email, password, confirm password).
* Error messages:

  * “Invalid credentials.”
  * “Email already exists.”
* Social login buttons styled clearly.
* Profile dropdown → “My Dashboard, Settings, Logout.”
* Redirect after login:

  * Student → `/dashboard/student`
  * Instructor → `/dashboard/instructor`
  * Admin → `/dashboard/admin`

---

### 8. 🔐 Security & Performance Notes

* Use **bcrypt** to hash passwords.
* Store only hashed passwords, never plain text.
* Use **JWT with HttpOnly cookies** for sessions.
* Rate-limit login attempts to prevent brute force.
* Use HTTPS in production.

---

### 9. ⚡ Edge Cases & Error Handling

* Wrong password → show error without exposing details.
* Expired session → auto logout with toast message.
* Social login failure → fallback to email login.
* User tries to access unauthorized page → redirect + warning.

---

### 10. 🧪 Testing Plan

**Unit Tests:**

* Password hashing & validation.
* RoleGate component behavior.

**Integration Tests:**

* Login → dashboard redirect.
* Session persists after refresh.

**E2E Tests (Cypress):**

* Sign up → auto login → lands on correct dashboard.
* Student cannot access admin routes.
* Invalid login shows error.

---

### 11. 📦 Dependencies

* `next-auth` – authentication framework.
* `bcryptjs` – password hashing.
* `jsonwebtoken` – JWT handling.
* `prisma` – user & role storage in DB.

---

### 12. ❓ Open Questions / Future Enhancements

* Should users be able to switch roles (e.g., Student → Instructor)?
* Should email verification be required before login?

---

### 13. 📌 Tasks Breakdown

* [ ] Setup `User` & `Role` models in Prisma.
* [ ] Configure NextAuth with credentials + Google/GitHub providers.
* [ ] Implement `<AuthForm />` and `<SocialLogin />`.

```
Student completes course → <CertificateGenerator> → /api/certificates → [DB: Certificate]  
Student → <CertificateViewer> → /api/certificates/:studentId → fetch & download PDF  
Public → <VerificationPage> → /api/certificates/verify/:certificateId → { valid/invalid }  
```

---

### 6. 📑 API Contracts

* `POST /api/certificates`
  → `{ certificateId, downloadUrl }`

* `GET /api/certificates/:studentId`
  → `{ certificates: [...] }`

* `GET /api/certificates/verify/:certificateId`
  → `{ valid: true/false, course, student }`

---

### 7. 🎨 UX & Design Notes

* **Certificate Design:**

  * Clean, professional layout with course logo & instructor signature.
  * Fonts: elegant serif for names/titles.
  * Background watermark to prevent forgery.

* **Student Dashboard:**

  * Certificates tab listing all earned certificates.
  * Each with “View” + “Download PDF” + “Share” buttons.

* **Verification Page:**

  * Enter certificate ID → shows student + course info.
  * If invalid → message: “Certificate not found or revoked.”

---

### 8. 🔐 Security & Performance Notes

* Unique UUID for each certificate.
* Prevent certificate access if student not logged in.
* Public verification exposes only minimal info (no sensitive data).
* Cache certificate verification results.

---

### 9. ⚡ Edge Cases & Error Handling

* Student tries to access certificate without completing course → reject.
* Certificate revoked by admin → verification returns “invalid.”
* Student requests duplicate download → reuse existing certificate.
* Failed PDF generation → retry with fallback template.

---

### 10. 🧪 Testing Plan

**Unit Tests:**

* Certificate ID generation.
* Completion validation logic.

**Integration Tests:**

* Complete course → certificate generated.
* Verify certificate ID returns correct data.
